## App Architecture

The SEEDS Android app is meticulously designed using the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) architecture to ensure an organized, scalable, and maintainable codebase. This architecture promotes the separation of concerns, making the development, testing, and maintenance of the app more efficient.

### Key Architectural Components

- **Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM):** The app follows the MVVM architecture, separating the user interface (View), business logic (ViewModel), and data (Model). This enhances code organization and reusability.

- **ViewModel:** The ViewModel manages data presentation and business logic, keeping the UI independent of data operations. It communicates with repositories for data retrieval and manipulation.

- **Repository Pattern:** Repositories abstract data sources and provide a consistent API to ViewModel. They manage data from various sources, like networks and local databases, ensuring data integrity.

- **Room Database:** Local data storage is handled using the Room Persistence Library, which simplifies database management and interaction, maintaining data consistency.

- **Retrofit for Networking:** Retrofit facilitates network requests, enabling seamless communication with remote APIs and efficient data retrieval.

- **Dependency Injection:** Kodein is used for dependency injection, enhancing modularity and reducing tight coupling between components.

- **LiveData and Observables:** LiveData and observables establish data-driven connections between ViewModel and UI, ensuring real-time updates.

- **View Binding:** View Binding simplifies the interaction between UI components and code by generating binding classes for XML layouts.

- **Navigation Component:** The Navigation component streamlines app navigation, providing a structured way to move between screens and enhancing the user experience.

This architecture ensures code readability, maintainability, and extensibility, allowing for efficient feature development and easy integration of new functionalities as the app evolves.
