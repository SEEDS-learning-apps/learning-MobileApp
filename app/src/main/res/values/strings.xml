    <string name="seeds_info">The corona pandemic has highlighted significant educational inequalities, where the shift to digital learning has left vulnerable groups, including people with migration or refugee backgrounds and non-native speakers, even further behind in terms of education. Limited access to digital technologies and a perceived closed education system will hinder their engagement in learning opportunities and societal participation. To address this issue, the SEEDS project proposes a combination of social and digital outreach, utilizing chatbots as a bridge between cultural mediators, social workers, and educational institutions. The project aims to create learning materials that can be accessed and tracked through a mobile device, via the chatbot system. The project promotes participatory action research and networked evaluation to identify appropriate contents and testing scenarios across Europe.
        Project funding: Erasmus+ Strategic Partnership
        Project duration: 2021-2023</string>
